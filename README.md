This codebase is part of the [HEP.QPR](https://hep-qpr.lbl.gov/) project and is built on [Qallse](https://github.com/derlin/hepqpr-qallse). Qaoala encodes charged particle track pattern recognition problems from the [TrackML](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification/data) dataset into a form which can be solved using a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)on a gate-based machine.
